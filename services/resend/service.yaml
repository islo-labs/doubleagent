description: Email sending and management API for developers, supporting transactional
  emails, batch sending, domain management, contacts, templates, and webhooks.
docs: https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/introduction
brief: 'Resend is a developer-focused email API service that enables applications
  to send transactional and marketing emails via a REST API. It provides a clean,
  modern alternative to legacy email providers like SendGrid and Mailgun, with first-class
  support for React Email components. The API is organized around core resources:
  Emails (send, batch send, schedule, cancel, retrieve), Domains (register, verify
  via DNS, configure tracking), Contacts (manage subscriber lists with properties
  and segments), Templates (create, publish, and send with variable substitution),
  API Keys (manage access with granular permissions), Broadcasts (bulk marketing emails
  to audiences), and Webhooks (subscribe to delivery events like sent, delivered,
  bounced, opened, clicked).


  This fake covers the primary API surface that AI agents would use: sending individual
  and batch emails, managing email lifecycle (scheduling, canceling, retrieving status),
  domain registration and verification, contact CRUD with subscription management,
  template creation and publishing, API key management, and webhook configuration.
  The API uses Bearer token authentication, enforces HTTPS, has a 2 req/sec rate limit
  per team, and supports cursor-based pagination on list endpoints. All responses
  follow a consistent pattern with an ''object'' field indicating the resource type.'
