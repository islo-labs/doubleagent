description: Todoist task management and productivity REST API fake
docs: https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/
brief: 'Todoist is a popular task management and productivity application used by
  millions of individuals and teams to organize work and personal tasks across web,
  mobile, and desktop platforms. The service provides a REST API (v2) that enables
  developers to programmatically interact with projects, tasks, sections, comments,
  and labels. The API supports natural language processing for task creation (e.g.,
  "tomorrow at 4pm", "every Monday"), priority levels (P1-P4), recurring tasks, task
  assignments, due dates, and collaborative features like comments and project sharing.


  This fake would cover the core REST API v2 endpoints for CRUD operations on all
  major resource types (projects, sections, tasks, comments, labels), along with task-specific
  operations like closing/reopening tasks, archiving projects, and managing shared
  labels. It would also include the Sync API v9''s webhook functionality for real-time
  event notifications (item:added, item:updated, item:deleted, project:added). The
  fake is particularly valuable for testing AI agent integrations, which commonly
  use Todoist for automated task creation, intelligent prioritization, natural language
  task management, and workflow automation across multiple platforms.


  The implementation would focus on the most common AI agent use cases: creating tasks
  with natural language due dates, filtering and searching tasks by labels/priority/projects,
  updating task status and priorities, managing project hierarchies with sections,
  and delivering webhook events for real-time task synchronization. This covers the
  essential API surface that automation tools, productivity integrations, and AI assistants
  rely on when integrating with Todoist.'
supported_flows:
- CRUD operations on projects including creating, updating, archiving, unarchiving,
  deleting projects, and retrieving project collaborators
- CRUD operations on tasks with support for natural language due dates (e.g., 'tomorrow
  at 4pm', 'every Monday'), priority levels (P1-P4), labels, and recurring task patterns
- Task lifecycle management including closing completed tasks, reopening tasks, and
  filtering active tasks by project, section, label, and priority
- CRUD operations on sections within projects for organizing tasks hierarchically
- CRUD operations on comments attached to tasks and projects with support for attachments
- CRUD operations on personal and shared labels including creating, updating, renaming
  shared labels, and removing shared labels
- Filtering and searching tasks using complex queries combining labels, priorities,
  due dates, and projects with AND/OR operators
- Webhook event delivery for real-time notifications on item:added, item:updated,
  item:deleted, and project:added events with HMAC signature verification
- Bearer token authentication and request idempotency using X-Request-Id headers for
  reliable task creation and updates
- Natural language processing for quick task entry with automatic parsing of due dates,
  priorities, project assignments, and labels from task descriptions
